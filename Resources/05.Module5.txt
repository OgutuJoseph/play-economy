Module 5 - Synchronous inter-service communication
Creating Inventory microservice
******


Introduction to synchronous communication
••• Microservice communication styles
• Synchronous
    -> The client sends a request and waits for a response from the service
    -> The client cannot proceed without a response
    -> The client thread may use a blocking or non-blocking implementation (callback)
    -> Two approaches
        1. REST + HTTP Protocol
            - the traditional approach
            - business subjects are modelled as resources (xml/json), and http pairs are used to manipulate them
        2.  gRPC 
            - increasingly popular approach for internal inter-service communication
            - uses http2

• Asynchronous
    -> The client sends a request to the service but the response, if any, is not send immediately.

Module 2 - Your first microservice
• Module objectives
    - Create a .NET microservice from scratch
    - Define the microservices REST API
    - Define the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) -> to establish contract between service and service clients.

1. Creating a microservice via the .NET CLI
    • Creating a dotnet app
        -> dotnet new webapi -n [Name : Play.Catalog.Service]
    • To specify .NET version during launch
        -> dotnet new webapi -n [Name : Play.Catalog.Service] --framework net5.0
    
    • Project Dir Analysis
    • .vscode -> contains files [test.json -> build and debug the app; launch.json -> how vscode launches the app]
    • Program.cs -> entrypoint which defines how we are to start the host / application
    • Startup.cs -> defines Service registration and request pipeline configuration
    • /Properties/launchSettings.json -> defines a number of things e.g.:
                                        -> applicationUrl -> defines what is the address of the microservice

    • Building app
        -> 1. [Inside Play.Catalog.Service] dotnet build
        -> 2. Terminal > Run Build Task > build [involes editing tasks.json and VSCode environemnt]

    • Running app
        -> [Inside Play.Catalog.Service] dotnet run
    
    • Install certs [to enable project to run on chrome, remove warning etc]
        -> dotnet dev-certs https --trust
